## Chapter 1. Introduction

Six-week cycles.
Shaping the work: A small senior group works in parallel tothe cycle teams, they define the key elements of the solution.
Shaped projects are concrete enough that the teams know what to do but abstract enough that they have room to work out the interesting detailsthemselves.
Appetite (asking how much time do we want to spend on it) instead of estimating (asking how much will it take).
Making teams responsible - give full responsibility to design+dev teams.
Risk: bet to 6 weeks, If a project runs over,by default it doesn’t get an extension.

## Chapter 2. Principles of Shaping

Wireframes are too concrete.
It's harder to re-think for designers if you give them a concrete thing.

Words are too abstract.
Properties of shaped work:
- rough (unfinished)
- solved (the main elements are there)
- bounded (indicates what not to do)

Steps to shaping:
- set boundaries
- rough out the elements
- address risks and rabbit holes
- write the pitch

## Chapter 3. Set Boundaries

Appetite - time budget.
Small Batch - a team of a designer and 2 devs can do in 1-2 weeks
Big Batch - the same team can do in 6 weeks

Bigger scope => narrow the problem or break it so that the part would fit in 6 weeks.

### Fixed time, variable scope
Estimates start with a design and end with a number.
Appetites start with a number and end with a design.

Good is relative, there is no best solution.

Default response to any idea => "maybe, some day".

### Narrow down the problem
Dig deeper and find out why the problem needs to be solved. It may lead to much simpler and quicker solution.
Sometimes it makes sense to ask “What could we build?” instead of “What’s really going wrong?”.

### Watch out for grab-bags
Unclear ideas, often like "redesign" or "refactoring".
Instead, figure out what's not working or working wrong.

### Boundaries in place
Move to the next step when you have 3 things: a raw idea, an appetite, and a narrow problem definition.

## Chapter 4: Find the Elements

An idea in words => the elements of a software solution.
- work alone or with a trusted partner
- not too many details in the sketches

Prototyping techniques: breadboarding and fat marker sketches.

### Breadboarding
- an electrical engineering prototype that has all the componentsand wiring of a real device but no industrial design.

Draw 3 basic things:
- places - you can navigate to (screens, dialogs, menus)
- affordances - a user can act on (buttons, fields, interfaces too)
- connection lines - show how the affordances take the user from place to place

Shaping will take a cloudy idea to a specific approach.

## Chapter 5. Risks and Rabbit Holes

An unanticipated problem that takes 2 weeks to solve, or even worse, a problem with no apparent solution.
An option is to abandon the project and rethink it later.
But we should look for the pitfalls we can find before betting on a project.

### Look for rabbit holes
Analyze: walk through a use case in slow motion, how exactly would a user get from a starting point to the end.
- does this require new tech work we've never done before?
- are we making assumptions about how parts fit together and the design?
- is there a hard decision we should handle in advance?

### Case study: Patching a hole
A hole in the concept - how to display completed tasks?
Decided to leave them exactly as they worked before.
Don't try to create the best design.

Present to technical experts, get an idea of what is possible in 6 weeks

At the end of this stage, we have the elements of the solution, patches for potential rabbit holes,and fences around areas we’ve declared out of bounds.

## Chapter 6. Write the Pitch

Now we need to put the conceptinto a form that other people will be able to understand, digest, and respond to.
Ingredients for the pitch:
- problem
- appetite
- solution
- rabbit holes
- no-gos

### Ingredient 1. Problem
Jumping right into working on a solution is dangerous.
We wouldn't want to spend 6 weeks on the solution that will only benefit a small percentage of customers.

### Ingredient 2. Appetite
Not only solve the problem but come up with a way to do this in 6 weeks.

> if we only care enough to spend two weeks on this now, how does this specific solution look?

### Ingredient 3. Solution
During the elements phase we draw the sketch ideas in the right level of abstraction.
Now we need to write at the right level of details.

We need some techniques to help people see the idea while still not going too far intoirrelevant details.

- embedded (in the page) sketches
- annotated fat marker sketches

### Ingredient 4. Rabbit holes
Writing to patch potential rabbit holes (e.g. specify details of the solution or edge cases that we don't need to handle)

### Ingredient 5. No Gos
E.g. specify that there will be no wysiwyg in the form.

Present a pitch:
- post the write-up with all ingredients
- stakeholders read it in their own time (async communication)
- people comment on the pitch asynchronously

## Chapter 7. Bets, Not Backlogs

Backlog are big time wasters.

### A few potential bets
A betting table -  look at pitches fromthe last six weeks or any pitches purposefully revived.
The pitches are potential bets. The meetings are infrequent, short, andintensely productive.
If we decide to bet on a pitch, it goes into the next cycle to build.

The great pitches can be lobbied again in 6 weeks if it's not right time for them right now.

### Decentralized lists
Everyone can still track pitches, bugs, requests, or things they want to doindependently without a central backlog (support, product, bugs)

Regular but infrequent one-on-ones between departments help to cross-pollinate ideas for whatto do next.

This way the conversation is always fresh.

### Important ideas come back
It's easy to overvalue ideas but they are cheap. Really important ones come back to you.

## Chapter 8. Bet Six Weeks

Some teams use 2-weeks cycles, but it's too little time to build smth meaningful. The time is not worth spending time planning and discussing.

After the 6-weeks period we have a 2-weeks cooldown. This is a period with no scheduled work to breath, meet and consider what to do next.
During cool-down, programmers and designers on project teams are free to work on whateverthey want.

### Team and project sizes
1 designer + 2 programmers or 1 designer + 1 programmer.
The teams will either spend the entire cycle working on one project or multiple smaller projects.

### The betting table
- is a meeting held during cool-down where stakeholders decide what to do in the next cycle.

Our betting table at Basecamp consists of the CEO (who in our case is the last word on product),CTO, a senior programmer, and a product strategist.

### The meaning of a bet
If we bet six weeks, then we commit to giving the team the entiresix weeks to work exclusively on that thing with no interruptions.

No "just a few hours" or "just one day" interruptions.

### The circuit breaker
By default, the project doesn't get an extention if it's not finished in 6 weeks.
If a project doesn’t finish in the six weeks, it means we did something wrong in theshaping.
We can use the shaping track on the next six weeks to come up with a newor better solution that avoids rabbit holes.

The circuit breaker motivates teams to take more ownership over their projects.

### What about bugs?
There is nothing special about bugs that makes them automatically more important thaneverything else.
If we’re in a real crisis, then drop everything to fix it. But that's rare. Most bugs can wait 6 weeks or longer.

Strategies to deal with bugs:

- Use cool-down
- Bring it to the betting table
- Schedule a bug smash
Once a year—usually around the holidays—we’ll dedicate a wholecycle to fixing bugs.

### Keep the slate clean
Never carry scraps of your old work to a betting table.

### Questions to ask
- Does the problem matter?
- Is the appetite right?
- Is the solution attractive?
- Is this the right time?
- Are the right people available?

### Make the announcement

After the bets are made, one of us will write a message that tells everyone which projects we’rebetting on for the next cycle and who will be working on them.

## Chapter 9. Hand Over Responsibility

### Assign projects, not tasks
We don’t start by assigning tasks to anyone. Nobody plays the role of the “taskmaster” or the “architect” who splits the project up into pieces for other people to execute.

Done means deployed.
Deploying - at the end of the cycle or in small batches if a team has multiple small projects.
Testing and QA is done within the cycle. Announcements and docs updates can be done at different time.

### Kick-off
The project starts with:
- creating a project
- posting a pitch
- kick-off call

### Getting Oriented
First days - not much communication, no tasks checked off. Everybody is figuring out how the existing system works and which starting point is the best.
Don't ask for visible progress at this stage.

### Imagined vs Discovered tasks
The team comes up with the tasks themselves. Naturally, the team starts off with the imagined tasks. While doing real work, we discover new tasks.
> The way to really figure out what needs to be done is to start doing real work.

## Chapter 10. Get One Piece Done

There should be one thing implemented that's possible to try out.
Integrate one slice (the corresponding backend/frontend/integration) so that the thing would be really done.

### Programmers don't need to wait
Affordances before pixel-perfect screens.
The first interface designer gives to a programmer is very basic.
Program just enough for the next step. Create a back-and-forth between design and programming on the same piece of a product.
3 criteria to choose what to build first:
- core (w/o it other work will mean nothing)
- small
- novel (prefer the things you've never done before, it would eliminate uncertainty)

## Chapter 11. Map the Scopes

### Organize by structure, not by person.
People often separate tasks by their role (programmer or designer). This could lead to a problem: these tasks won't add up to a finished part of a project early on.
We call integrated slices of the project scopes. The overall scope is broken into separate scopes that can be finished independently.

### The Scope Map
As the team starts doing real work on a project they learn what actually the tasks are and what's the structure of a project. Then they factor the project into scopes.
We define and track the scopes as to-do lists.

### The Language of the Project
Scopes become the language of the project at the macro level. It's easier to reason about what's done and not done and the order to be done in this way, in comparison to discussing individual tasks.

First: make a list of unscoped tasks and start working on smth.
Then, focus on "get one piece done", focus on one key interaction you can integrate. Create a new scope for this piece and put "todos" into it.
After finishing this scope, revise the unscoped tasks that you have. At this point they don't represent the work needs to be done.
You can extract a new scope and tasks to work on. While working on it, you'll discover a more suitable scopes structure and new todos.
You'll see the whole project at the high level.

### Discovering scopes
Scope mapping isn't planning. You need to start working before you can draw the map.
Scopes arise from interdependencies. At the start of the project we don't see accurate scopes.
At the beginning the team focuses on specific problems so that it's easier to identify that scope early.

### How to know if the scopes are right
When you define the scopes correctly:
- you can see the whole project, and don't worry about the missing details
- conversations become more flowing, because you use the right language
- you know where to put a new task when it comes up (scopes are like bucketss)

The scopes should be redrawn if:
- it's hard to say when the scope is "done". The tasks in the scope are unrelated.
- the name isn't unique to the project (e.g. "front-end" or "bugs" are grab-bags)
- the scope is too big to finish soon

### Layer Cakes
The work can be judged by UI surface area because back-end work is thin and evenly distributed.

### Icebergs
Sometimes there is significantly more backend work or UI work.
For icebergs, it sometimes makes sense to factor out the UI as a separate scope. The backend work could be split into several scopes as well.
The goal is to define different things you can finish and integrate in stages.
But first, question if you need the UI or back-end complexity at all.

### Chowder
- a list for loose tasks that don't fit anywhere.
But be careful if the list gets too long (more than 3-5 items).

### Mark nice-to-haves with ~
A lot of new tasks and possible improvements come up while you're working on the problem, but the time is limited.

## Chapter 12. Show Progress

Ideally, managers should see the status of the tasks without having to explicitly ask for them.
Todos can be used for this but there are a couple of problems with them.

### The tasks that aren't there
Sometimes there are lists with all tasks completed, that could mean that all the work is done but can also mean that the further tasks were not defined yet.
Or the scope is defined early but there are no tasks yet.

QA can add tasks to the scope at the end of the project.
Todos actually grow when team makes progress, so it's hard to guess what time the project will take, esp. at early steps.

### Estimates don't show uncertainty

If you try to estimate a task with a lot of uncertainties, like doing smth the team has never done before, or has uncertain dependencies, your estimate will likely be very vague.

We came up to see status of the project w/o counting tasks and w/o numeric estimates.
We shifted focus from what's done and not done to what's unknown and what's solved.

### Work is like a hill

unknown phase (figuring out what to do)
peak of the hill
known phase (getting it done)

### Scopes on the hill

You can combine the hill with the concept of scopes: putting them at different positions on the sides of the hill and using different colors for different scopes.

### Status w/o asking
A feature in Basecamp so that managers could see the state of the scopes w/o asking: displaying the hill + scopes.

### Nobody says "I don't know"
It's easier to see if someone is stuck - the chart says it instead of people.

### Prompts to refactor the scopes
Sometimes the work is going fine but the dot on the hill is not moving. E.g. there is a need to refactor scopes, like split a scope into different ones.

### Build your way uphill
Sometimes unexpected unknowns appear. It's often because someone did the uphill work with their head instead of their hands.
The first third uphill - "I've thought"
The second third - "I've validated"
The third - "I'm far enough with what I've built"

### Solve in the right sequence
Some scopes are riskier than others.
Ask the question: if we were out of time at the end of the cycle - which we could finish easier?
This motivates the team to push the scariest way uphill first.
It's better to get a few critical scopes uphill early.

> Work expands to fill the time available

Choose the most important problems with the most unknowns first. At the end of the cycle the team should end up with the important work done and variety of "nice to haves" and "maybes" lingering around.

## Chapter 13. Decide when to stop

Shipping on time means shipping smth imperfect. Is it good enough?

### Compare to baseline
Baseline - what customers already have.
If the current solution is better than the current alternatives, it makes us feel better with the progress we've made.

### Limits motivate trade-offs
Trade-offs instead of cramming and pushing to finish.

- Scope grows like a grass
- Cutting scope is not lowering quality
  differentiating what is core and what is peripheral

### Scope hammering
Even stronger than cutting :D

musts vs nice-to-haves (~)
~ are usually never built!

### QA is for the edges
Designers and programmers take responsibility for the basic quality of their work.
QA person comes at the end of the cycle and hunts for edge cases.

We don't depend on QA to ship quality features.

QA generates discovered tasks, progr/designers triage them, and make some of them "must-haves".

### When to extend a project
Rare cases!
Cool down can be used to finish some must-haves but this shouldn't become a habit.

## Chapter 14. Move On.

Let the storm pass, stay cool after shipping the feature (usually you'll get a lot of feature requests after it)
Stay debt-free. Don't make immediate changes after receiving the feedback.
Feedback needs to be shaped. If a request is truly important, shape it in the next cycle.

## How to implement
- add people to do the pitches
- post pitches as messages
- shape
- create a project
- add team members
- post a kick-off message with the shaped concept

To-do lists for scopes:
- the team gets oriented, starts discovering tasks and mapping them into scopes
- the team creates a todo for each scope
- add design and progr tasks to each scope todo items
- add scopes and todos as they are discovered

Track scopes on the hill chart

## Adjust to your size

Separate basic truths from the specific practices.
Shaping, betting and the building phase are basic. The specific practices are scale-dependent.

### Small enough to wing it

A tiny team can throw out most of the structure (like 6-weeks, cooldown, formal pitching and betting)
The phases of the work still hold true even if you don't work in cycles or have dedicated people to do the shaping and building.

### Big enough to specialize

At some point when there are more people available to build there is a need for someone to carve out more time to figure out what to build.
E.g. the founder spends more time shaping than building or elevating an employee to do more shaping work.
Shapers work on shaping while builders build. 2 weeks cooldown is used for fixing bugs and address popping loose ends by builders, and for betting by shapers.

## How to begin Shape Up
### New vs Existing products

Shaping, betting and building won't work if you work on a completely new product or using a new technology. You need to figure out the basic architecture first.
Early phase: "R&D mode" - build enough to be confident about the architecture.
Dedicate one team and six weeks to explore a few features. Don't separate them into shapers and builders yet.

Then flip from "R&D" to "production" mode. At this point the first team is ready to separate the shaping and delegate shaped work to others in the form of bets.
Sometimes the same approach can be used for an existing product when there is a new area of work with an unsettled architecture.

### Option A. One 6-week experiment

Guarantee that no one will interrupt programmers and designers during the experiment.
Don't worry about mapping the scopes or showing progress right away.
You should see a big progress just by shaping work in advance, providing uninterrupted time, and letting the team figure out the details.

After getting used to "Get one thing done", the team works on properly mapping the scopes. Then, work on "Show Progress".

### Option B. Start with shaping

Present a project and put it through existing scheduling process. This can already make things better and open up to the new things like longer cycles and betting.

### Option C. Start with cycles

Moving from like 2 weeks sprint to 6-weeks cycle removes the need to constantly plan meetings, gives more time to build and provides more room to breathe.

Fix shipping first - get the team into a rhythm of finishing things.

Focus on the end result - the outcome is all that matters, you shouldn't worry on "what if someone of the team members sits idle at some point".
